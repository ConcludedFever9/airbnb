    "## Why Regression Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting Airbnb prices using regression models offers several advantages for both hosts and guests alike. By leveraging various predictors such as host response metrics, accommodation attributes, and review scores, these models can provide valuable insights into pricing strategies and help optimize the booking experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilize regression models to inform hosts' pricing strategies, enabling them to base decisions on empirical data rather than intuition alone. Enhance the guest experience by providing transparent and predictable pricing, guided by regression models that consider various factors impacting accommodation quality and value. Deliver personalized recommendations to hosts regarding optimal pricing strategies and to guests regarding relevant listings, leveraging regression models to analyze historical data and user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will employ three different regression models to predict Airbnb prices: Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Random Forest Regression, and Neural Network Regression. Each model offers unique advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)**:\n",
    "   SLR provides a straightforward approach to modeling the relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable (price). It's particularly useful for identifying linear relationships and understanding the individual impact of each predictor on the target variable. We'll use SLR to establish a baseline performance and interpret the coefficients of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Forest Regression**:\n",
    "   Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and handle nonlinear relationships and interactions between predictors. It's robust to overfitting and can handle a large number of input variables with ease. We'll leverage Random Forest Regression to capture complex interactions between predictors and enhance prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Neural Network Regression**:\n",
    "   Neural Network Regression, specifically deep learning architectures, can capture intricate patterns and relationships within the data, allowing for highly flexible modeling without relying on explicit feature engineering. Neural networks excel at learning nonlinear relationships and can adapt to complex datasets with high dimensionality. We'll utilize Neural Network Regression to capture nonlinearities and interactions that may not be captured effectively by traditional regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluation, we'll use Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the scoring metric for all three models. MSE provides a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual prices, allowing us to assess the accuracy of the models' predictions.\n"
