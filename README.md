# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a data-driven approach for optimizing Airbnb accommodations in Berlin by predicting prices, forecasting demand and analyzing guest sentiment. The data cas be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) under the Berlin section. 

# Key Components

- Price Prediction: Develop a machine learning model to predict the price of Airbnb listings in Berlin based on various features such as location, property type, number of bedrooms, amenities, etc. This model will help hosts set competitive prices and maximize revenue.

- Demand Forecasting: Analyze historical booking data to forecast the demand for Airbnb accommodations in different neighborhoods of Berlin over time. By understanding demand patterns, hosts can optimize pricing, availability, and marketing strategies.

- Sentiment Analysis: Analyze guest reviews to extract insights about the overall sentiment, common themes, and areas for improvement in Airbnb listings. Understanding guest sentiment can help hosts enhance the guest experience and attract more bookings.

# Findings

From the regression analysis conducted in this notebook, it was determined that all three models mentioned exhibit comparable performance, as evidenced by their Mean Squared Error (MSE) values. Specifically, the Simple Regression model yielded an MSE of 9336, while the Random Forest model achieved 9490, and the Neural Network Regression model recorded a value of 9327.
